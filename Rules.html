    <h1><span class="span-header">üìú Rules üìú</span></h1>
    <p class="p1">
    ATTENTION <br>
Not knowing the rules is not an excuse.<br>
Take your time to read all of the rules and make sure you understand them.<br><br>

The rules can change at any time, so make sure to check them from time to time.

    </p>
    <h><span class="span-header">üìî General Rules</span></h>
    <p>
1. Be respectful to all community members. Harassment of any kind is not tolerated and will be punished. This includes IC and OOC.<br><br>
2. All sexual/pornographic,ethnic, religious and political talk is not to be discussed. There are lots of other places you can make it happen. This is a safe space for everyone.<br><br>
3. No RMT (real money trading) is allowed.<br><br>
4. The administrative staff has the final say, don't try to argue. If you feel something is not fair or wrong, you can send a ticket and we will check it.<br><br>
5. No advertisement or other communities are allowed.<br><br>
6. This is given, but of course follow Discord's Terms of Use when using our discord server (https://discord.com/guidelines)<br><br>
7. NO LOOPHOLING! Do not try to find loopholes in any of the rules written. If something isn't clear, try to understand the logic behind the rule, and of course contact us so we can explain it better.<br><br>
8. HAVE FUN! The biggest goal of this community is to have fun. Again, if you feel something isn't right and/or someone harassed you, contact us and we will investigate.
</p>

<h><span class="span-header">üñ±Ô∏è Server Rules</span></h>
<p>
1. Since we're an RP Lite server, RPing is strongly encouraged but not a necessity. As long as everyone is having fun, it's good to go.
2. Safehouses are available to everyone, given they survived 3 in-game days. All locations except POI are claimable with reason. (IE: 1 player cannot claim a whole mall, because he cannot handle it by himself.) Big buildings to claim need to be approved by admins first. <br><br>
3. Sledgehammers are allowed, but don't go and destroy half of the world just because. Use sledhammers for breaking in places, not breaking down places.<br><br>
4. Same rule applies to fire. Fire is allowed, but don't use it in order to just grief and destroy the world.
</p>
  </body>

  <h><span class="span-header">ü™ñ RP Rules</span></h>
  <p>
1. No explicit sexual RP is allowed. That includes but not limited to Rape, Sex or excessive sexual harrasment content. (Hugs and kisses are allowed)<br><br>
2. RP is strongly encouraged when near other players. Since we're an RP LITE server, it is not mandatory, but adds a lot of development to the characters.<br><br>
3. No META Gaming while RPing. That means that you cannot use information that you gathered from OOC (ie from discord). Of course you can coordinate and plan OOC, but you cannot do that while in action. (IE: You can plan a raid on a zombie infested mall OOC, but when you actually do it IC, you cannot use discord or other means of OOC).<br><br>
4. Real life people or underage characters are not allowed. (IE: you can't make a character of a big celebrity IRL).<br><br>
5. No RP Harassment, griefing or trolling is allowed. You cannot just go and antagonize someone without/weak RP situation.<br><br>
6. RP world integrity. There are lots of player written letters and journals. If you find something in the world like this, don't destroy or take it with you, leave it for others to enjoy it too.

  <h><span class="span-header">‚öîÔ∏è RP PvP Rules</span></h>
  <p>
  - This rules apply when people are engaging in a PvP during RP!<br><br><br><br>
  1. Hostile RP PvP is of course allowed and needs to follow the next rules. That being said, the goal is to create a deep story for both parties. There is no reason to go dominating another group just for the sake of it<br><br>
  2. No KoS or Deathmatch (That includes  firearms, weapons and vehicles) games out of nowhere! A proper motive needs to be present for this to occur!<br><br>
  3. Comply or Die - When an aggressor wants to engage in a hostile RP, he should make it clear to the victim. Clear commands and outcomes should be said in-game chat, VOIP or OOC! Same rules apply to the victim.<br><br>
   3a. The aggressor should only demand logical things that the victim can comply with.<br><br>
   3b. The aggressor must give enough time for the victim to make a reaction, the same rule applies to the victim.<br><br>
   3c. If the aggressor chooses a violent outcome if his demands aren't met, he must flag himself as PvP before engaging in that situation, so that the victim knows that the outcome will be lethal if he doesn't comply.<br><br>
   3d. There are 2 sorts of non-compliance for the victim: Aggressive & Passive. The victim can choose to not comply and defend himself, but as said before, it needs to be clearly stated beforehand by IC or OOC means, and the victim must enable his PvP tag until it is seen by the aggressor.
    The second option is Passive non-compliance, in which case the victim tries to run away from the aggressor, the aggressor can attack the victim in that situation.<br><br>
   3e. The Aggressor should always present a back down option for the victim at least once for each RP situation!<br><br>
   3f. Stealing loot is for RP purposes mostly, not for getting ‚Äúrich‚Äù. You can take 1 item per victim (1 weapon as is, 1 ammo box etc) or 5 items such as food or money stacks. That being said, the victim can give you more if he agrees and wants the RP scene to go that way.<br><br>
4. No Combat Logging! That means that one cannot simply log out of game mid combat (Both PvP and PvE situations). THIS ACTION WILL NOT BE TOLERATED!<br><br>
5. Safehouses are a safe place to their owners, but that doesn't mean that one cannot be robbed by a Hostile RP interaction. An aggressor can threaten, take hostages or make hostile actions to try and demand to get inside someone's safehouse.<br><br>
 5a. The victim cannot try and escape this situation by just getting inside his safehouse.

  </p>

    <h><span class="span-header">‚öîÔ∏è Normal PvP Rules</span></h>
  <p>
  - This rules apply when people are engaging in a PvP outside of RP!<br><br><br><br>
  1. If you want to engage in PvP outside of RP, you have to have PvP-Tag Enabled so other's can know your intentions.<br><br>
  2. No backstabs! You can't befriend someone just to turn on PvP Tag and kill him. You can betray someone, but can't kill him just out of nowhere. Let him know first. <br><br>
  3. No Spawn Killing!

  </p>

  <h><span class="span-header">üöò Vehicle Rules</span></h>
  <p>
   1. You can claim a vehicle by right clicking on it.<br><br>

 2. Stealing someone's vehicle is only allowed for RP purposes. That means that you cannot just go and steal someone's vehicle just for the sake of it or for increasing your car fleet.<br><br>
  2a. What that means is that you can steal a car during a hostile PvP for example, but you must leave the car behind after 6 hours IRL at most, and contact the player owning the car OOC to tell them where the car was left.<br><br>
  2b. You cannot steal loot from player's claimed car. You may leave behind the loot on the ground for RP purposes (to make room for another player in order to flee a raid for example), but again, you must let the player know where you dropped the loot immediately!<br><br>
  2c. Car stealing is only allowed while the owner is aware and witnessing the theft.<br><br>

3. It is forbidden to disassemble cars that are above 45% overall condition. <br><br>
 3a. That means you cannot destroy a car with above 45% condition. You may however switch parts with another car, as long as you leave the donor car with the same type of part you took from it.<br><br>
 3b. There is a mod for creating engine parts using scrap. You need to first find a magazine and read it. This is to reduce server load for destroying cars for scrap or engine parts.

  </p>

  <h><span class="span-header">üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èRP Raid Rules</span></h>
  <p>
   1. Raids is when someone decides to attack a safehouse, claimed or walled off with a sign of ownership.<br><br>

 2. Raids are not for loot hoarding but more for deep RP purposes. <br>
  2a. You have to have a good RP reason for making raids.<br><br>
  2b. The max loot you can steal is 1 full bag for the entire attacking party.<br><br>

 3. Raids must occur when at least one of the owners of the safehouse is online, and after it's been approved via a sent ticket by the staff.<br><br>

  3a. Raids may occur while the attacked party is offline only for spying purposes (leaving a walkie-talkie inside, observing the safehouse). <br><br>

 4. After a raid occurs, you leave behind clues depending on the setting and location of the raid (IE: If it happens while it's raining you leave behind footprints/tire tracks).<br><br>
  4a. The staff is in charge of leaving clues for the attacked party to investigate and try to find out who raided them.<br><br>

 5. There are 2 types of raids - Stealthy and Aggressive. Stealthy approach leaves less clues after the raid is done.<br><br>
  5a. Stealthy is when you try to break inside without the victims          knowing. For example if you have a burglar, you can try and break locks (It is done via emotes, a dice is rolled by staff to decide if the lockpicking was successful.)<br><br>
  5b. Aggressive approach is breaking inside with force. Yet again, it is done via emotes, so no reason to really break someone's doors or windows.<br><br>
  5c. In both approaches, KoS is not allowed, and the victims must be given the option to surrender. If they choose not to surrender but fight, they must make it clear, and both parties organize for a PvP fight following PvP rules.
