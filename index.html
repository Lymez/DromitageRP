    <p class="main-paragraph">In the start of 1997, an unexpected and chilling event unfolded, altering the course of history forever.<br> A mysterious zombie outbreak swept across the globe, leaving devastation in its wake.<br>  The source of the outbreak was traced back to a leaked biological weapon, which transformed ordinary individuals into ravenous, undead creatures.<br>  Panic ensued as the infected rapidly multiplied, leaving governments and society at large struggling to cope with the catastrophe.<br>  Despite the valiant efforts of military forces and civilian volunteers, major cities crumbled under the onslaught of the undead.<br>  The world was forced to adapt to this horrifying new reality, leading to the rise of survival communities and a grim, dystopian existence.<br>  The 1997 zombie outbreak became a stark reminder of the fragility of human civilization and the potential consequences of unchecked scientific progress.<br> <br> Your story begins here, but where will it end?</p><br>
